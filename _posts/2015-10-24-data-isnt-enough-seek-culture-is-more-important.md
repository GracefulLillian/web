title: "Seek culture is critical for using data well"

Two of the biggest shifts that have come from technology in the last 10 years are:

- It used to be hard to share information widely and now it’s easy
- It used to be hard to communicate back and forth with lots of people and now it’s easy

These shifts change how we can organise ourselves, who we can listen to, and how we can make decisions. They also change expectations for information sharing – now information can be shared more easily there is more focus on what should be shared, who has the right to see it, and who has the right to use it.

Data is talked about a lot. Every organisation seems to be trying to figure out how data fits into their world. Many assume data is the new gold, but don't really know how to use it.
