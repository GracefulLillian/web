Two of the biggest shifts that have come from technology in the last ten years are: it used to be hard to share information widely, and now it’s easy; and it used to be hard to communicate with lots of people in multiple directions, and now it’s easy.

These shifts can change everything – how we organise ourselves, how we make decisions, who makes decisions, and whose voices we can hear. The shifts also change expectations for information sharing, it makes us look harder at who has the right to see what information, and how it can be used. We’re only at the very beginning of these changes, and sometimes we forget to look at the whole context.
